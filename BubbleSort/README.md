# Bubble Sort   

**ABSTRACT**

Bubble sort a.k.a. sinking sort is kind of sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.   

## 1. Algorithm   


## 2. Time Complexity   
_NOTE: Suppose we want ascending ordered data_

### Average
   
### Best Case
When the given data are in a ascending order, it's O(n) by Big O notation  

### Worst Case    
When the given data are in a descending order, it's Ðž(n^2) by Big O notation
