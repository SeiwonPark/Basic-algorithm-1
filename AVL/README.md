# AVL   

**ABSTRACT**   
This is kind of self-balancing Binary Search Tree. 
It was devised by Adelson-Velskii and Landis to reduce time complexity of Binary Search Tree of which it is `O(n)`. 
And in AVL tree, it gets `O(log n)` time complexity. 
Being balanced means that height of the left sub-tree and height of the right sub-tree differ by at most one.
