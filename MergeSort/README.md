# Merge Sort   

**ABSTRACT**

Merge sort   

## 1. Algorithm   


## 2. Time Complexity   
_NOTE: Suppose we want ascending ordered data_

### Average
Regardless of the given data, it gets O(n log n) time complexity by Big O notation

### Best Case
Regardless of the given data, it gets O(n log n) time complexity by Big O notation  

### Worst Case    
Regardless of the given data, it gets O(n log n) time complexity by Big O notation
