# Quick Sort   

**ABSTRACT**

Quick sort   

## 1. Algorithm   


## 2. Time Complexity   
_NOTE: Suppose we want ascending ordered data_

### Average
It gets O(n log n) time complexity by Big O notation on average. It's the same with that of Merge Sort, but usually Quick Sort is way faster.

### Best Case
It gets O(n log n) when it's using simple partition or O(n) when it's using three-way partition  

### Worst Case    
If the given data is in descending order, it gets O(n^2) time complexity by Big O notation
